## building

This requires:
    - Hare (0.24+)
    - raylib (made with Raylib 5+, could possibly go back a few)
    - raylib bindings (included here as submodule)

the `libraylib.a` included won't work for you, I included it on accident and
git won't let me remove it from this commit.

instructions
    - Build raylib to get `libraylib.a` and move it to the root dir of this repo
    - run the command `hare run -L. -lraylib -lm`
